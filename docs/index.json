[{"content":"‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequesites I only mention any tips that I found are NOT well documented on the internet, for common problems, please look at other articles for more references These can be applied for Unreal Engine 5 and above. For anyone working with lower version, it \u0026ldquo;might\u0026rdquo; be different. Feel free to hit me up if my information is misleading or wrong. Replicated Tags AddReplicatedLooseGameplayTag does not actually add any tags on the caller side. For example, if you add replicated tags on the server, only the clients will receive the tags (through MinimalReplicationTags replication) but the tag will not be added on the server itself. The same applied for RemoveReplicatedLooseGameplayTag, becareful!\nIf you want to add / remove the tag on the server and also replicate them to other clients, use UAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary::AddLooseGameplayTag / UAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary::RemoveLooseGameplayTag\nYou should NOT use AddLooseGameplayTag or RemoveLooseGameplayTag with replicated tags on the Client (unless you\u0026rsquo;re authoritive / server). Add or remove loose gameplay tag on the client will eventually get overriden by the replicated version of that tag. Example: You add Tag.Example tag on the client 5 times. On the Server you AddReplicatedLooseGameplayTag with that same tag 1 times. Thus, it will get overriden on the Client when the Server replicates the MinimalReplicationTags to the Client. The server will not care if that tag is \u0026ldquo;locally\u0026rdquo; added or not when it comes to replicated tag.\nReplication Client Server Before replication 5 1 After replication 1 1 Expected 6 1 If you want the server to respect the locally added tag, you will have to workaround by creating new tag called Tag.Example.Replicated. This tag will be used for replication (ability tag, add replicated loose tag,\u0026hellip;) and for adding tag locally we will use Tag.Example. This will seperate the tag and avoid getting overrided by the Server.\nSpecify tag root ","permalink":"https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/gameplay-tag/","summary":"Gotcha tips you might not know when using Gameplay Tags with GAS","title":"Using Gameplay Tags with GAS"},{"content":"About Me My name is Nguyen Lam Tuong (Bacon) I am based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam I have a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from HCM University of Science Check out my üü¶ LinkedIn for the latest updates on my professional profile.
